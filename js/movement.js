// TODO: you can use this file to implement movement behavior

// We decided against giving you too much guidance, because we feel the more we provide, 
// the more you are being forced into our structure for writing WebGL applications. 
// Since there isn't a single best way, we'll just provide rough guidance so you can
// implement movement in any way you feel works with your data structure.

// Our implementation: We used an abstract movement class that we extended by the type of movement that we needed for a specific behavior (e.g. orbit movement)
